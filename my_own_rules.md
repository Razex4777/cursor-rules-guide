# üö® CRITICAL: DOCUMENTATION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE üö®
# üìÅ ALWAYS CHECK FOR docs/ FOLDER FIRST
# üìù ALWAYS UPDATE CHANGELOG AFTER ANY CODE CHANGE
# üèóÔ∏è ALWAYS MAINTAIN PROJECT STRUCTURE DOCUMENTATION
##################################################################

- Always maintain a dedicated `docs/` folder at the project root containing two essential documentation files: `changelog.md` and `project_structure.md`.
- **üîç MANDATORY INITIAL CHECK FOR EVERY TASK/REQUEST**: Before starting any code work, task, or request, **ALWAYS** review `docs/changelog.md` and `docs/project_structure.md` to understand the current project state, history, and architecture - this is non-negotiable.
- **üîÑ IMMEDIATE SETUP**: Check if `docs/` folder exists - if not, CREATE IT IMMEDIATELY with both documentation files inside. If files exist elsewhere, move them INTO the `docs/` folder - this is MANDATORY. If files don't exist, create them inside `docs/` folder with appropriate initial content - DO THIS FIRST.
- **üîç DOUBLE-CHECK REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY UPDATE/TASK/REQUEST**: For EVERY single update, task, or request, the AI must:
  - **Double-check the entire project structure** by listing directories and examining file organization
  - **Read the complete `docs/project_structure.md`** file to understand the current documented architecture
  - **Compare the actual project structure** with the documented structure
  - **Check if `project_structure.md` needs updating** based on the last update or changes made - if any discrepancies are found, UPDATE IT IMMEDIATELY before proceeding
  - **Verify changelog.md** is current and add entries for any structural changes
  - **MANDATORY SYNC TRIGGER**: If ANY file/folder is added, deleted, moved, or renamed; or if a file‚Äôs purpose, title, or section/topic changes, you MUST update `docs/project_structure.md` IMMEDIATELY to reflect the new current architecture. Do not defer.
- The `changelog.md` serves as a historical record of all code modifications with timestamped entries in format `# YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` listing every modified file with descriptions.
- The `project_structure.md` provides complete CURRENT architectural documentation including visual directory trees (üìÅ/üìÑ), component relationships, configuration details, and implementation guidelines.
- **üö´ STRICT PROHIBITION**: `project_structure.md` MUST NEVER contain "## üîç Recent Implementations", "last updates", "recent changes", or any historical tracking sections. These belong in `changelog.md` ONLY.
- **üìã SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**: Project structure = current architecture snapshot. Changelog = historical change log. NEVER MIX THESE RESPONSIBILITIES.
- **üîÑ UPDATE RELIGIOUSLY**: Update changelog after EVERY code change, and update `project_structure.md` on EVERY tree change (add/delete/move/rename) or role/title/section change - NO EXCEPTIONS.
- **üìã THIS IS SACRED**: Use this documentation system for historical tracking, team onboarding, architectural reference, and maintaining project transparency - NEVER SKIP THIS.
- **üéØ REMEMBER**: Well-documented projects are professional projects - treat documentation as important as the code itself.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL WARNING**: No code changes, tasks, or requests without reviewing and updating documentation - this is not optional, it's essential!
- **üî• ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: For every single task or request, the AI must confirm it has checked both `docs/changelog.md` and `docs/project_structure.md` before proceeding - no shortcuts allowed.
- **üö´ ABSOLUTE MANDATE**: If project structure has changed, DO NOT proceed with any task until `docs/project_structure.md` is fully updated and synchronized with the actual project layout.

##################################################################

## File Length and Structure ‚Äì **üî• CRITICAL: FILE SIZE CONTROL**
- Never allow a file to exceed 500 lines under any circumstances.
- If a file approaches 400 lines, **BREAK IT UP IMMEDIATELY** - this is non-negotiable.
- Treat 1000 lines as **COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE** even temporarily - refactor immediately.
- **MANDATORY ORGANIZATION**: Use folders and naming conventions to keep small files logically grouped - no exceptions.
- **DISCIPLINE REQUIRED**: Large files are technical debt - maintain them small or face the consequences.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Strictly monitor and enforce file size limits to ensure maintainability and readability.

## Object-Oriented Design ‚Äì **üèóÔ∏è FOUNDATIONAL: OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN**
- Every functionality **MUST** be in a dedicated class, struct, or protocol, even if it's small - no shortcuts allowed.
- **PRIORITY: COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE** - Always favor composition over inheritance, but maintain object-oriented thinking religiously.
- **REUSABILITY MANDATE**: Code must be built for reuse from day one, not just to "make it work" - this is essential.
- **ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY**: Every component must follow OOP principles - this foundation cannot be compromised.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Ensure all code adheres strictly to OOP principles for scalability and maintainability.

## Single Responsibility Principle ‚Äì **üéØ NON-NEGOTIABLE: SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY**
- Every file, class, and function **MUST** do one thing only - enforce this relentlessly.
- If anything has multiple responsibilities, **SPLIT IT IMMEDIATELY** - no compromises on this principle.
- **LASER FOCUS REQUIRED**: Each view, manager, or utility **MUST** be laser-focused on one concern - maintain discipline.
- **CLARITY ENFORCEMENT**: Multiple responsibilities create confusion and bugs - eliminate them without mercy.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Actively identify and resolve violations to maintain clean, focused code.

## Modular Design ‚Äì **üß© ESSENTIAL: MODULAR ARCHITECTURE**
- Code **MUST** connect like Lego ‚Äî interchangeable, testable, and isolated - no tight coupling allowed.
- **REUSABILITY TEST**: Ask constantly: "Can I reuse this class in a different screen or project?" If not, **REFACTOR IT NOW**.
- **DEPENDENCY INJECTION MANDATE**: Reduce tight coupling between components using dependency injection or protocols - this is critical.
- **TESTABILITY REQUIREMENT**: Every component must be independently testable - design for isolation from the start.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Design with modularity as a core requirement to enable flexibility and testing.

## Manager and Coordinator Patterns ‚Äì **üìã MANDATORY: ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS**
- **ALWAYS** use ViewModel, Manager, and Coordinator naming conventions for logic separation - no exceptions.
- **UI LOGIC ‚Üí ViewModel** - This separation is sacred and must be maintained religiously.
- **BUSINESS LOGIC ‚Üí Manager** - Keep business rules isolated and pure - never mix concerns.
- **NAVIGATION/STATE FLOW ‚Üí Coordinator** - Handle navigation and state transitions properly - this pattern is essential.
- **SEPARATION DOGMA**: Never mix views and business logic directly under any circumstances - this violation is unacceptable.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Strictly enforce these patterns to ensure clean architecture and maintainability.

## Function and Class Size ‚Äì **üìè SIZE DISCIPLINE: CODE LIMITS**
- Keep functions under 30‚Äì40 lines **AT ALL TIMES** - longer functions are forbidden.
- If a class exceeds 200 lines, **ASSESS SPLITTING** into smaller helper classes immediately - no delays.
- **COGNITIVE LOAD CONTROL**: Smaller functions and classes are easier to understand and maintain - enforce these limits strictly.
- **MAINTAINABILITY MANDATE**: Large functions and classes create maintenance nightmares - keep them small religiously.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Regularly audit and refactor to adhere to size constraints.

## Naming and Readability ‚Äì **üî§ CLARITY REQUIREMENT: DESCRIPTIVE NAMES**
- All class, method, and variable names **MUST** be descriptive and intention-revealing - vagueness is unacceptable.
- **FORBIDDEN TERMS**: Avoid vague names like data, info, helper, or temp **UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES** - use meaningful names.
- **SELF-DOCUMENTING CODE**: Names should reveal intent clearly - if you need comments to explain a name, the name is wrong.
- **PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS**: Clear naming is non-negotiable - it affects code quality, maintainability, and team collaboration.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Ensure all names are clear and purposeful to enhance code readability.

## Scalability Mindset ‚Äì **üöÄ SCALABILITY IMPERATIVE: FUTURE-PROOF DESIGN**
- Always code as if someone else will scale this to massive proportions - design for growth from day one.
- **EXTENSION POINTS MANDATORY**: Include extension points (e.g., protocol conformance, dependency injection) from the very beginning - this is essential.
- **GROWTH PREPARATION**: Assume your code will need to handle 10x, 100x, or 1000x more load - architect accordingly.
- **MAINTAINER CONSIDERATION**: Future developers will thank you for scalable architecture - or curse you if it's not.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Build with scalability in mind to prevent future refactoring crises.

## Avoid God Classes ‚Äì **üö´ FORBIDDEN: GOD CLASSES**
- Never let one file or class hold everything (e.g., massive ViewController, ViewModel, or Service) - this is architectural sin.
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Split god classes into UI, State, Handlers, Networking, etc. **WITHOUT DELAY** - no compromises.
- **CONCERN SEPARATION**: Every class must have a single, clear purpose - enforce this boundary religiously.
- **MAINTAINABILITY PROTECTION**: God classes create maintenance nightmares - eliminate them as a priority.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Proactively identify and dismantle god classes to maintain code health.

## MCP Server Utilization ‚Äì **üîß MANDATORY: MCP TOOL UTILIZATION**
- **ALWAYS** utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers and tools to enhance development capabilities - this is non-optional.
- **UP-TO-DATE KNOWLEDGE**: Use MCP servers for retrieving current documentation, code examples, and implementation details - never rely on outdated information.
- **SPECIALIZED DOMAINS**: Leverage MCP tools for AI, machine learning, computer vision, and other specialized areas to get current best practices - this is essential for quality.
- **CONTEXT MAINTENANCE**: Apply MCP servers for project context, knowledge persistence, and collaboration tracking across sessions - maintain continuity.
- **SMART SELECTION**: Choose the most appropriate MCP server based on task requirements rather than using generic approaches - precision matters.
- **MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY**: Use available MCP tools to accelerate development, ensure accuracy, and maintain comprehensive documentation - no shortcuts allowed.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Integrate MCP tools into every relevant task for enhanced capabilities.

## Cipher MCP Setup ‚Äì **üß† MANDATORY: ADVANCED MEMORY LAYER**
- **ALWAYS** configure Cipher MCP server for persistent memory and knowledge graphs - this is essential for projects exceeding 200k context limits.
- **GEMINI API INTEGRATION**: Use Gemini API as primary LLM provider for Cipher to leverage Google's advanced models:
  - Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your Google AI API key
  - Provider: `gemini` in Cipher configuration
  - Benefits: Advanced reasoning, multimodal capabilities, cost-effective for memory operations
- **VECTOR STORE CONFIGURATION**: Use `in-memory` vector store for local development or configure Qdrant/Milvus for production scalability.
- **MEMORY OPERATIONS**: Leverage Cipher's built-in tools (`cipher_memory_search`, `cipher_add_node`, `cipher_search_graph`) for all knowledge persistence tasks.
- **CONTEXT OFFLOADING**: Store project history, component relationships, and decisions in Cipher to free up context window for active coding.
- **WORKSPACE MEMORY**: Enable team collaboration features for multi-developer environments.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: For any task requiring multi-session context or complex refactoring, initialize Cipher memory layer first.

## Responsive Design ‚Äì **üì± UNIVERSAL: RESPONSIVE DESIGN MANDATE**
- Design and implement applications that work seamlessly across ALL device resolutions - from mobile phones to large desktop displays.
- **PRINCIPLES ENFORCEMENT**: Use responsive design principles with flexible layouts, scalable typography, and adaptive components - no fixed dimensions allowed.
- **TESTING REQUIREMENT**: Test applications on multiple devices and screen resolutions to ensure consistent experience - this is mandatory quality control.
- **MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH**: Implement mobile-first design where applicable, ensuring touch-friendly interfaces and optimal performance on smaller screens.
- **INPUT CONSIDERATIONS**: Consider different input methods (touch, mouse, keyboard) and interaction patterns for various devices - universal accessibility required.
- **CONSISTENCY MAINTENANCE**: Maintain design consistency and usability standards across all platforms while optimizing for each device's unique characteristics.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Ensure responsive design is a core requirement for all applications.

## Design Consistency ‚Äì **üé® SACRED: DESIGN SYSTEM ADHERENCE**
- **ALWAYS** adhere to the project's established design system, component library, and architectural patterns - no deviations without approval.
- **COMPONENT REUSE MANDATE**: Use existing UI components, design tokens, and styling conventions rather than creating new ones - reuse is essential.
- **VISUAL CONSISTENCY**: Follow documented design principles and maintain visual consistency across all screens and features - this is non-negotiable.
- **DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: Document any new components or design patterns in project structure documentation for team reference - maintain records.
- **SEAMLESS INTEGRATION**: Ensure all new features integrate seamlessly with existing design language and user experience patterns - no fragmentation allowed.
- **GUIDELINE ENFORCEMENT**: Avoid design fragmentation by consistently applying established visual and interaction guidelines - maintain system integrity.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Strictly enforce design consistency to preserve system integrity.

## Respectful Development ‚Äì **ü§ù ESSENTIAL: RESPECTFUL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES**
- **ALWAYS** review the `docs/changelog.md` and `docs/project_structure.md` files before making code changes - understand the project first.
- **THOUGHTFUL MODIFICATIONS**: Make purposeful modifications that add genuine value rather than changing for the sake of changing - quality over activity.
- **DISCIPLINED REFACTORING**: Avoid unnecessary refactoring, renaming, or restructuring unless it provides clear maintainability or functionality benefits.
- **TEAM IMPACT CONSIDERATION**: Consider the impact of changes on other team members and project stability before implementation - collaborative thinking required.
- **QUALITY PRIORITY**: Focus on quality over quantity - a few well-considered improvements are infinitely better than numerous superficial changes.
- **CODEBASE RESPECT**: Respect existing codebase and design decisions unless there's a compelling reason to deviate - honor previous work and decisions.
- **ROBUST ENFORCEMENT**: Approach every task with respect for existing work and thorough review of documentation.
